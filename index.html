                    <b>Dr. Kate Alexandra, DMA</b> (she/her) is a private teacher, educator, and performer based in Chicagoland. In 2019, Kate earned her doctorate in double bass performance with a cognate in arts administration from the University of Cincinnati, College-Conservatory of Music.
                </p>
                <p class="black">
                    Throughout her career, Kate has been an advocate of arts education as a way to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion. She embodied this praxis with her doctoral project in which she commissioned a selection of works by nine women composers and highlighted the need for representation among composers and inclusion among bass performers. Her dedication to bringing new and different perspectives to double bass repertoire resulted in the recording of these works, as well as a world premiere at the International Society of Double Bassists Convention in 2023.
                </p>
                <p class="black">
                    As an educator, Kate has consistently sought ways to increase access and representation as an extension of her doctoral research. Most recently, Kate taught remote lessons to her students at Withrow University High School (Cincinnati, OH), where she had previously held several workshops, coached chamber music, and instructed group lessons. Kate presented educational workshops for high school students on topics such as efficient and effective practice methods, bowing distribution, and ear training. These workshops were sponsored and funded in part by concert:nova and the Benjamin Carlson-Berne Scholarship Fund, whose mission is to expose economically disadvantaged children and youth to classical music. From 2017 to 2019, Kate worked as the music theory instructor and teaching assistant at the Cincinnati Double Bass Institute. Kate has also delivered a presentation for music specialists on chamber music with double bass obbligato. In 2019, Kate premiered five new works with double bass for Cincinnati Soundbox at the 21c Museum Hotel.

                <p class="black">
                    Throughout her career, Kate has participated in summer festivals including the Hawaii Performing Arts Festival as a Professional Fellow studying with Mr. Jeff Bradetich and Dr. Gudrun Raschen (2017) and Sewanee Summer Music Festival studying with Sid King (2013).
                </p>
                <p class="black">
                    She was honored with the Katherine Anne Suber-Whiton Memorial Award for Double Bass Excellence in 2012 and 2010 from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
                </p>
                <p class="black">
                    Her influential teachers include Rachel Calin, Albert Laszlo, Maurice Todd, Paul Erhard, Nick Recuber, Jenny West, Miriam Bijkerk, Jason Heath, and Jamie Chen. Kate performs on a contrabass labeled Josef Chramosta Nove Benatry from 1880 that was recently restored by the Cincinnati Bass Cellar.

                    Currently, she is an active member of the ASTA Private Studio Committee and served as a panelist on its roundtable during the 2021 National Conference. Kate is life member of the International Society of Double Bassists.

                    My research seeks to address equity in the twenty-first century double bass solo repertoire through an intersectional approach to living women composers that takes into account race, gender, class, age, nationality, etc. To accomplish this, I commissioned a selection of works by women composers representing diverse set of demographics and backgrounds, which will result in a premiere performance in 2021. There are still other avenues of diversity, equity, and inclusion that need to be addressed in double bass repertoire, academia, and many more voices (both composers and performers) that need to be heard.

                        Connect with individual donors. According to Giving USA 2018: The Annual Report on Philanthropy for the Year 2017, “Charitable giving was buoyed by individual giving, which rose $14.27 billion to an all-time high in 2017.” This report was researched and written by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, available online at www.givingusa.org.

                        Be prepared to reach out to other individual donors via the strategies laid out by Tom Ahern in How to Write Fundraising Material That Raise More Money: The Art, the Science, the Secrets (Medfield, Massachusetts: Emerson & Church Publishers, 2018) and Penelope Burk in Donor-Centered Fundraising Donor-Centered Fundraising: How to Hold on to Your Donors and Raise Much More Money (Chicago: Cygnus Applied Research, Inc., 2013), 104-07.

                        Consult Commissioning Music: A Basic Guide (2009) produced by Meet the Composer, Inc. (now New Music USA) to determine a standard commission fee. This guide was recommended to me by several composers as I brainstormed this project. A more detailed guide is available here. In addition to this guide, you can review Johanna Keller’s An Individual’s Guide to Commissioning Music (2003), a published booklet that contained stories from eight individuals (ages 50+ with disposable income) and their commissioning experience. However, the commissioning costs mentioned in the booklet might be unrealistic for smaller projects. In my experience, all of the composers were willing to work within my more limited project budget.

                        Community centric fundraising movement (CFF). As mentioned on CFF website, while the majority of philanthropy in the US comes from individual donors, “traditional ways of fundraising uphold patriarchy, classism, white supremacy and other structural oppressions.” In addition to CFF movement, follow Vu Le’s blog Nonprofit AF and read Collecting Courage: Joy, Pain, Freedom, Love, a “collection of personal experiences written by Black fundraisers.”

                        As said on their website, Institute for Composer Diversity operates within the School of Music at the State University of New York at Fredonia. The Institute has published the two online databases: “Composer Diversity Database” and the “Works Diversity Database.” You can search by selecting from basic criteria (living, deceased, gender, non-binary, etc.), genre (orchestra, chamber, etc.), demographic, and location in the “Composer Diversity Database.” This then directs you to a list of composers and their websites. I found this resource to be a useful first step in discovering composers from various backgrounds. For more information, visit https://www.composerdiversity.com/.
